                        Hey! My name is Tadd and I am a passionate developer who
                        likes to create things. I like to engineer my
                        applications in a way that is easy to read, but also
                        performant. My favorite work lies at the intersection of
                        design and development, so that experiences I create
                        look great but are also give the user a fantastic
                        experience.
                    </p>
                    <p className="opacity-50">
                        Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I
                        specialize in front end development with a focus on
                        modern React. I continuously explore new technologies to
                        expand my skill set, and am currently looking into
                        expanding my skillset in backend technologies.

                        In my free time, you will find me playing my guitar,
                        working on my senior project, programming something new,
                        studying DSA, working out, or playing pickleball.
